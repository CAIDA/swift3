Swift3
------

The Openstack Swift community has imported the Swift3 middleware into Swift's codebase as the "s3api" middleware. Swift3 development is now frozen and all new patches should go to s3api middleware. Refer to [documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/middleware.html#module-swift.common.middleware.s3api.s3api) for more information deploying s3api middleware.
